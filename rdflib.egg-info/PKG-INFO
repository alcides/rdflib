Description: RDFLib is a Python library for working with RDF, a simple yet powerful language for representing information.
        
        The library contains parsers and serializers for RDF/XML, N3,
        NTriples, Turtle, TriX and RDFa . The library presents a Graph
        interface which can be backed by any one of a number of Store
        implementations, including, Memory, MySQL, Redland, SQLite,
        Sleepycat and SQLObject.
